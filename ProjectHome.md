In computer science, raptor codes are the first known class of fountain codes with linear time encoding and decoding. They were invented by Amin Shokrollahi in 2000/2001 and were first published in 2004 as an extended abstract. Raptor codes are a significant theoretical and practical improvement over LT codes, which were the first practical class of fountain codes.(Wikipedia)

This open source implementation of Raptor code has been programmed and tested by Hossein Rouhani Zeidanloo. It has been implemented mainly for Research purposes.
